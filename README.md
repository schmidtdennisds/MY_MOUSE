# Welcome to My Mouse
***

## Task
The challenge is to develop an algorithm which finds the shortest way between an entry and exit in a labyrinth.

## Description
I solved the problem by implementing an breadth first search.

## Installation
To install the project run make.

## Usage
You can use the maze_generator.rb script to generate a map:
```
./ruby maze_generator.rb 100 100 "* o12" > test.map
```
and then run the my_mouse with:
```
make
./my_mouse test.map
```
